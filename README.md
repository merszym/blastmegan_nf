# BLAST MEGAN (nextflow edition)

To compare [quicksand](github.com/mpieva/quicksand) with the BLAST+MEGAN based workflow described in Slon et al, 2017 I created this quick-and dirty nextflow pipeline that is a reimplementation of the snakemake pipeline. 

I need the pipeline to work on already demultiplexed files and to provide me a summary table similar to the one provided by quicksand. Since the snakemake pipeline is not working for me, this is the opportunity to reimplement it...
